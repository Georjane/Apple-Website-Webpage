This is a clone of an old version of the Apple website webpage using HTML & CSS.

![screenshot](images/screenshot.png)

In this project, the website of one of the most design-forward companies in the world was cloned. It‚Äôs not a very complex site but it uses background photos and gradients. The project was built using images as a background and adding gradients to elements.
It has as main sections:
- a navigation bar whose position is relative and has a width of about 80% of the viewport
- a paragraph and anchor element which displays text on the main billboard background
- an aside element containing images in a grid display
- and lastly a footer with anchor elements
